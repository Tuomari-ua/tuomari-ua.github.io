These furred boots are snug and feel quite warm. While you wear them, you gain the following benefits:

* You have resistance to cold damage.
* You ignore difficult terrain created by ice or snow. You can tolerate temperatures as low as −50 degrees Fahrenheit without any additional protection. If you wear heavy clothes, you can tolerate temperatures as low as −100 degrees Fahrenheit.
