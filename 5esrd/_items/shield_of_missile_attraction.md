_Armor (shield), rare (requires attunement)_ 

While holding this shield, you have resistance to damage from ranged weapon attacks.

**Curse.** This shield is cursed. Attuning to it curses you until you are targeted by the **_remove curse_** spell or similar magic. Removing the shield fails to end the curse on you. Whenever a ranged weapon attack is made against a target within 10 feet of you, the curse causes you to become the target instead.
