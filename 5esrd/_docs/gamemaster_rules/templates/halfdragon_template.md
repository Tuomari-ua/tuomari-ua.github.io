# Half-Dragon Template

A beast, humanoid, giant, or monstrosity can become a half-dragon. It keeps its statistics, except as follows.    
**Challenge**. To avoid recalculating the creature's challenge rating, apply the template only to a creature that meets the optional prerequisite in the Breath Weapon table below. Otherwise, recalculate the rating after you apply the template.    
**Senses**. The half-dragon gains blindsight with a radius of 10 feet and darkvision with a radius of 60 feet.    
**Resistances.** The half-dragon gains resistance to a type of damage based on its color. 

| Color               | Damage Resistance |
|---------------------|-------------------|
| Black or copper     | Acid              |
| Blue or bronze      | Lightning         |
| Brass, gold, or red | Fire              |
| Green               | Poison            |
| Silver or white     | Cold              |

**Languages**. The half-dragon speaks Draconic in addition to any other languages it knows.    
**New Action: Breath Weapon.** The half-dragon has the breath weapon of its dragon half. The half-dragon's size determines how this action functions.

| Large or smaller | As a wyrmling      | Challenge 2 or higher |
