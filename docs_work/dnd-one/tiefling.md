Tieflings are either born in the Lower Planes or
have one or more fiendish ancestors who
originated there. A tiefling (pronounced TEEF-
ling) is linked by blood to a devil, a demon, a
yugoloth, or some other Fiend. This connection
to the Lower Planes is, for better or worse, the
tiefling’s fiendish legacy, which comes with the
promise of power yet has no effect on the
tiefling’s moral outlook.
A tiefling chooses whether to embrace or
lament their fiendish legacy. The three legacies
are as follows:
Abyssal. The heartless entropy of the Abyss, the
howling chaos of Pandemonium, and the vast
despair of Carceri call to tieflings who have
the Abyssal fiendish legacy. Horns, fur, tusks,
black blood, and peculiar odors are common
physical features of such tieflings, most of
whom have the blood of demons coursing
through their veins.
Chthonic. Tieflings who have the Chthonic
fiendish legacy not only feel the tug of Carceri
but also the greed of Gehenna and the
underworld gloom of Hades. Some of these
tieflings look cadaverous. Others possess the
unearthly beauty of an incubus or a succubus,
or they have physical features in common
with a night hag, a yugoloth, or some other
Neutral Evil fiendish ancestor.
Infernal. The Infernal fiendish legacy binds
tieflings by blood not only to Gehenna but
also the raging battlefields of Acheron and the
diabolical Nine Hells. Horns, spines, tails,
golden eyes, and a faint odor of sulfur or
smoke are common physical features of such
tieflings, most of whom trace their ancestry to
devils.

T IEFLINGS OF M ANY W ORLDS
Tieflings born in the Lower Planes often
migrate to other planes of existence and never
look back. Their descendants are scattered
across many worlds and are especially
prevalent in Sigil, the torus-shaped city at the
center of the multiverse.
The earliest tieflings joined ranks with non-
tieflings to repel fiendish incursions on many
worlds, earning the trust of those who might
otherwise have mistaken them for Fiends.
Thanks to the victories and sacrifices of these
legends, tieflings throughout the multiverse
enjoy widespread acceptance.
