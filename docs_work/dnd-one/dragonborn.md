The earliest dragonborn hatched from the eggs
of chromatic and metallic dragons. One story
holds that these eggs were blessed by the
dragon gods Bahamut and Tiamat, who wanted
to populate the worlds of dragons with people
created in their image. Another story holds that
dragons created the first dragonborn without
the gods’ blessings. Whatever their origin,
dragonborn have made homes for themselves
on the worlds of the Material Plane.
Dragonborn look like wingless, bipedal
dragons—scaly, bright-eyed, and thick-boned,
with horns on their heads. Dragonborn of
chromatic ancestry have scales that are black,
blue, green, red, or white, whereas dragonborn
of metallic ancestry have scales that are the
color of brass, bronze, copper, gold, or silver.
When two dragonborn whose scales are of
different colors produce a child, their offspring’s
scales match those of one parent or the other.
Like their draconic ancestors, dragonborn can
exhale acid, cold, fire, lightning, or poison. One
can tell the type of energy a dragonborn
breathes by the color of the dragonborn’s
scales.

determined by your Draconic Ancestry trait. On
a successful save, a creature takes half as much
damage.

Damage Resistance. You have Resistance to
the damage type determined by your Draconic
Ancestry trait.

D RAGONBORN OF M ANY W ORLDS
Like dragons, dragonborn have a mystical bond
to the Material Plane and are spread across its
many worlds.
On some worlds, the earliest dragonborn
settlements were built near dragon lairs so that
the dragonborn could pay tribute to their
draconic progenitors. Many of these ancient
settlements still exist. For example, the dragon-
ruled continent of Argonnessen (on the world of
Eberron) has dragonborn cities tucked among
its mountain ranges.
On other worlds, dragonborn ply their skills
in settlements populated mostly by non-
dragonborn, fulfilling an urge to expand their
presence and influence, much as dragons do.
