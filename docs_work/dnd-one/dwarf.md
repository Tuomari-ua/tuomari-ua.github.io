Resilient like the mountains, dwarves were
raised up from the earth in the elder days by a
deity of the forge. Called by various names on
different worlds—Moradin, Reorx, and others—that god gave dwarves an affinity for stone and
metal and for living underground.
Squat and often bearded, the original dwarves
carved cities and strongholds into
mountainsides and under the earth. Their
oldest legends tell of conflicts with the monsters
of mountaintops and the Underdark, whether
those monsters were towering giants or
subterranean horrors. Inspired by those tales,
dwarves of any culture often sing of valorous
deeds—especially of the little overcoming the
mighty.

D WARVES OF M ANY W ORLDS
On some worlds in the multiverse, the first
dwarven settlements were built in hills or
mountains, and the dwarven families who trace
their ancestry to those settlements call
themselves hill dwarves or mountain dwarves,
respectively. Oerth and Krynn (the worlds ofthe Greyhawk and Dragonlance settings,
respectively) are examples of worlds that have
such dwarven communities.
In other worlds, dwarves have given
themselves other cultural designations. For
example, on the continent of Faerûn in the
Forgotten Realms, the dwarves of the south call
themselves gold dwarves, and the dwarves of
the north are shield dwarves.
