Cherished and guided by gods who value life,
home, and hearth, halflings gravitate toward
bucolic havens where family and community
help shape their lives. That said, many halflings
are blessed (some might say cursed) with a
brave and adventurous spirit that leads them on
journeys of discovery, affording them the
chance to explore a bigger world and make new
friends along the way. Their size—being not
unlike that of a human child—helps them avoid
unwanted entanglements and slip into and out
of tight spaces.
Anyone who has spent time around halflings,
and particularly halfling adventurers, has likely
witnessed the storied “luck of the halflings” in
action. When a halfling is in mortal danger, it
seems as though an unseen force intervenes on
the halfling’s behalf. Many halflings believe in
the power of luck, and they attribute their
unusual gift to one or more of their benevolent
gods, including Yondalla, Brandobaris, and
Charmalaine.

H ALFLINGS OF M ANY W ORLDS
On many worlds, halflings are walking, talking
contradictions: home, tradition, and pastoral
pursuits collide with a gods-given love of
adventure and a knack for getting into and out
of trouble. Halfling communities come in all
varieties. For every sequestered halfling shire
tucked away in some unspoiled corner of the
world, there’s a halfling crime syndicate like the
Boromar Clan on the world of Eberron or a
territorial mob of halflings like those found on
the world of Athas.
Some halfling settlers, particularly ones who
prefer to live underground, are thought to have
a little bit of dwarven blood coursing through
their veins and are sometimes called
strongheart halflings or stouts. Nomadic
halflings, as well as those who live among
humans and other tall folk, are sometimes
called lightfoot halflings or tallfellows
