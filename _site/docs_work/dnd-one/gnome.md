Gnomes are magical folk created by gods of
hard work, invention, trickery, and life
underground. The earliest gnomes were seldom
seen by other folk due to the gnomes’ secretive
nature and their propensity for lairing in sylvan
forests, hillside burrows, and sprawling
warrens under mountains. What they lacked in
size, they made up for in cleverness and
cunning. They confounded predators with
elaborate traps and low, narrow, labyrinthine
tunnels. They also learned useful magic from
gods like Garl Glittergold, Baervan
Wildwanderer, and Baravar Cloakshadow, who
often lived among them (usually in disguise).
Gnomes are petite folk with big eyes, pointed
ears, and wistful imaginations. Harkening back
to a time when their ancestors hid in tunnels
and under thick forest canopies, many gnomes
like the feeling of a roof over their head, even if
that “roof” is nothing more than a hat.

G NOMISH L INEAGES
Lineage Benefit
Forest
Gnome
You know the Minor Illusion cantrip.
You can also cast the Speak with
Animals Spell with this trait. You can
cast it with the trait a number of
times equal to your Proficiency
Bonus, and you regain all expended
uses when you finish a Long Rest.*
You can also use any Spell Slots you
have to cast the Spell.
Rock
Gnome
You know the Mending and
Prestidigitation cantrips
In addition, you can spend 10
minutes casting Prestidigitation to
create a Tiny clockwork device (AC 5,
1 HP), such as a toy, a fire starter, or
a music box. Casting the Spell in this
way consumes 10 GP worth of raw
material (string, gears, and the like),
which you provide during the casting.
When you create the device, you
determine its function by choosing
one effect from Prestidigitation; the
device produces that effect
whenever you or another creature
takes a Bonus Action to touch the
device and activate it. If the chosen
effect has options within it, you
choose one of those options for the
device when you create it. For
example, if you choose the spell’s
ignite-extinguish effect, you
determine whether the device ignites
or extinguishes fire; the device
doesn’t do both.
You can have three such devices in
existence at a time, and each one
dismantles itself 8 hours after its
creation. You can also touch one of
your devices and dismantle it as an
Action. After a device is dismantled,
the 10 GP of materials used to create
it can be reclaimed.
G NOMES OF M ANY W ORLDS
Gnomes past and present are known to equate
secrecy with safety, which is why gnome
settlements are often tucked away or concealed
by magical illusions.
Forest Gnomes. Gnomes who have ancestral
ties to forests are called forest gnomes. They
use their magic to befriend small forest animals
and rely on them for news concerning their
neighbors—be they malevolent or benign.
Rock Gnomes. Gnomes whose ancestors
dwelled under mountains are called rock
gnomes. On some worlds, including Krynn (the
world of the Dragonlance setting), rock gnomes
are also known as tinker gnomes due to their
fondness for artifice and clockwork inventions
