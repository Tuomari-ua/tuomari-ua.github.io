Created by the god Corellon, the first elves
could change their physical forms at will. The
elves lost this ability when Corellon exiled them
from Arvandor for plotting with another elven
deity named Lolth, who tried and failed to usurp
Corellon’s dominion. When Lolth was cast down
into the Abyss, most elves renounced her
treachery and earned Corellon’s forgiveness,
but that which Corellon had taken from the
elves was lost forever.
No longer able to shape-shift at will, the elves
retreated to the Feywild, where their sorrow
was deepened by that plane’s influence. Over
time, wanderlust and curiosity led many of
them to explore other planes of existence,
including various worlds in the Material Plane.
Elves have the mystical ability to take on
characteristics of the environments with which
they are bonded—drow to the Underdark, high
elves to fey crossings in the Material Plane, and
wood elves to forests. These connections grant
elves access to certain kinds of magic.
Elves are blessed with long lives and long
memories. From birth, they don’t sleep but
instead enter a trance when they need to rest. In
this state, elves remain aware of their
surroundings while immersing themselves in
their own memories. What an elf remembers
during this reverie depends largely on how long the elf has lived and the events that have
shaped the elf’s existence.
Elves have pointed ears and tend to be light
on their feet. Another common physical
characteristic of elves is their lack of facial and
body hair.

E LVES OF M ANY W ORLDS
After leaving the Feywild, elves established
deep roots on worlds throughout the
multiverse. Within their respective domains,
elves often use their magic and other resources
to build fabulous enclaves. The subterranean
cities and outposts of the drow, the gleaming
towers and citadels of the high elves, and the
forest sanctuaries of the wood elves are nothing
short of architectural wonders, which reflect
their builders’ otherworldly origins.
Drow. Known for their white hair and dusky-
gray skin tones, drow typically dwell in the
Underdark. Noteworthy exceptions include
Drizzt Do’Urden and Jarlaxle Baenre, two drow
adventurers of the Forgotten Realms who shun
their subterranean homeland. Some drow
societies avoid the Underdark altogether. On
the world of Eberron, for example, drow dwell
in gloomy rainforests and cyclopean ruins on
the continent of Xen’drik.
High Elves. On some worlds, high elves refer
to themselves by other names. For example, the
sun elves and moon elves of Toril (the world of
the Forgotten Realms setting) are high elves, as
are the Silvanesti and Qualinesti of Krynn (the
world of Dragonlance) and the Aereni of
Eberron.
Wood Elves. Wood elves are known across
the multiverse by many other names, including
wild elves, green elves, and forest elves.
Grugach are reclusive wood elves on Oerth (the
world of the Greyhawk setting), while the
Kagonesti and the Tairnadal are wood elves of
Krynn and Eberron, respectively.
