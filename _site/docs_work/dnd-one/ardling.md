Ardlings are supernal beings who are either
born on the Upper Planes or have one or more
ancestors who originated there. Their bright
souls shine with the light of immortal beings
who call the Upper Planes homeAn ardling has a head resembling that of an
animal, typically one with virtuous associations.
Depending on the animal, the ardling might also
have soft fur, downy feathers, or supple bare
skin. The ardling’s celestial legacy determines
the animal it resembles.
An ardling gains a measure of magical power
from their celestial legacy, as well as the ability
to manifest spectral wings. An ardling’s moral
and ethical outlook is self-determined, however,
not fixed by ancestry.
The three celestial legacies are as follows:
Exalted. The fierce passions of Arborea, the
heroic heart of Ysgard, and the wondrous
nature of the Beastlands call to ardlings who
have the Exalted celestial legacy. Their
celestial ancestors are heroic champions of
the Chaotic Good planes.
Heavenly. The blissful harmony of Arcadia, the
unwavering justice of Mount Celestia, and the
bucolic paradise of Bytopia touch the souls of
ardlings who have the Heavenly celestial
legacy. Their celestial ancestors are staunch
defenders of the Lawful Good planes.
Idyllic. The Idyllic celestial legacy connects
ardlings not only to the Beastlands and
Bytopia but also to the eternal compassion of
Elysium. Their celestial ancestors are
paragons of kindness who hail from the
Neutral Good planes.

Celestial Legacy. You are the recipient of a
celestial legacy that grants you magical abilities.
Choose a legacy from the Celestial Legacies
table: Exalted, associated with Chaotic Good
planes; Heavenly, associated with Lawful Good
planes; or Idyllic, associated with Neutral Good
planes. You gain the initial benefit of the chosen
legacy: a cantrip that you learn. You also choose
the animal you most closely resemble; the table
provides a few suggestions for each legacy (you
don’t gain wings by choosing an animal that can
fly).
Starting at 3rd level and again at 5th level,
you gain the ability to cast a higher-level Spell
with this trait, as shown on the table. Once you
cast the Spell with this trait, you can’t cast that
Spell with it again until you finish a Long Rest;
however, you can cast the Spell using any Spell
Slots you have of the appropriate level.
Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma is your
spellcasting ability for the Spells you cast with
this trait (choose the ability when you select the
legacy).
Damage Resistance. You have Resistance to
Radiant Damage.
A RDLINGS OF M ANY W ORLDS
Ardlings bring a little bit of the Upper Planes
with them wherever they go. On many worlds,
the first ardlings used the magic of their
celestial legacies to inspire and heal others.
By virtue of their celestial legacies, some
ardlings strive to make the world a better place.
Others use their supernal gifts to be the best
version of themselves they can be. Still others
are delighted to have a connection to the Upper
Planes without the responsibility of always
having to do the right thing.
