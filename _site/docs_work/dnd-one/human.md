HUMAN
Found throughout the multiverse, humans are
as varied as they are numerous. They are
relatively short-lived, but they strive to achieve
as much as they can in the years they are given.
They are skilled pioneers and artisans. They are
builders of nations, roads, cities, and ships. They
strive to secure their place in the world and in
the annals of history by creating art, amassing
wealth, making laws, and questing for
immortality. Their ambition and
resourcefulness are commended, respected, and
feared.
Humans are as diverse in appearance as the
people of Earth, and they have many gods.
Scholars dispute the origin of humanity, but one
of the earliest known human gatherings is said
to have occurred in Sigil, the torus-shaped city
at the center of the multiverse and the place
where the Common tongue was born. From
there, humans could have spread to every
corner of the multiverse, bringing Sigil’s
cosmopolitanism with them.

H UMANS OF M ANY W ORLDS
On any given world in the multiverse, the
material culture of humans can change from
one region to another. In the Forgotten Realms,
for example, the clothing, architecture, cuisine,
music, and literature are wildly different in the
Western Heartlands than in the frozen north of
Icewind Dale.
As humans migrate, they bring elements of
their cultures with them, giving rise to diverse
settlements that contain people with different
physical characteristics, not to mention a
medley of clothing styles, customs, and beliefs.
