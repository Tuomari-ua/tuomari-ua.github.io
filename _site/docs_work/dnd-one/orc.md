Orcs trace their creation to Gruumsh, the One-
Eyed God, an unstoppable warrior and powerful
leader. Gruumsh armed his children with
certain gifts to help them thrive on worlds beset
by monsters. Even when they turn their
devotion to other gods, orcs retain the gifts that
the One-Eyed God bestowed upon them: might,
endurance, determination, and the ability to see
in the dark.
Orcs are, on average, tall and broad. They
have gray skin, ears that are small and slightly
pointed, and prominent lower canines that
resemble small tusks. Young orcs are often told
about their ancestors’ ancient conflicts with
elves in forests, dwarves under mountains, and
invaders from evil planes of existence. Inspired
by those tales, young orcs often wonder when
Gruumsh will call on them to match the heroic
deeds of their ancestors, and if they will prove
worthy of the One-Eyed God’s grace.

O RCS OF M ANY W ORLDS
On many worlds, orcs occupy territory claimed
by their ancestors. Their settlements and
strongholds can be found almost anywhere,
above ground and below.
Orcs sometimes flock to the banners of
powerful monarchs. King Obould Many-Arrows
of Toril (the world of the Forgotten Realms
setting) is one such figure, his strength
tempered by a willingness to make peace with
his enemies.
On worlds such as Eberron, orcs were among
those who defended the natural order from the
encroachments of Fiends and other extraplanar
threats. Their descendants learned to live in
harmony with their neighbors and the natural
world, and to many of them, Gruumsh’s wars
are distant memories.
